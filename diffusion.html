    <h2>Diffusion of light</h2>
    <p>
      At the core, photography is the problem of finding a way to present 3 dimensional geometry (the world) in a 2 dimensional space (the photograph) in a manner similar enough to the way our own eye performs the same task to trick it into believing what it's seeing is actually 3 dimensional. Said another way, we're trying to trick our eyes into believing we're observing depth on a flat surface (ie., paper, a canvas, a photograph, a computer screen, etc.) Lets take a look at an example of what we mean by that.
